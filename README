Konqlets is Konqueror Bookmarklets in Action. The project will focus on two
issues: 1. Building a secure, proof of concept, and 2. Highlight areas in KJS
that need upgrading to provide sufficient support.

The JavaScript KIO provides DCOP communication in a way that
executes the script in the active Konqueror window.  This allows for
Bookmarklets to operate as advertised.

If the DCOP interfaces to Konqueror are insufficient to facilitate a clean and
secure way to interact with bookmarklets, then a plugin will be developed that
publishes the appropriate interfaces.  The plugin will have close access to
Konqueror's API and as such could aid in making developing a clean approach to
bookmarklets a feasibility rather than an impossibility.
